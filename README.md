As part of my hands-on learning and project development experience, I have applied SQL (Structured Query Language) extensively in projects involving CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. CRUD represents the fundamental actions necessary for managing persistent data in databases, and SQL served as the backbone for efficiently performing these tasks.
The Create operation was implemented using INSERT INTO queries to add new user records to the database. The Read functionality was handled with SELECT statements, allowing the retrieval of user details based on various filters and conditions. For instance, I wrote queries to fetch user data using JOIN clauses to combine data from multiple related tables.
To implement the Update functionality, I used UPDATE queries that allowed users to modify their profile information while ensuring data validation. Lastly, the Delete functionality was executed using DELETE FROM statements, enabling users or admins to remove records when necessary.
